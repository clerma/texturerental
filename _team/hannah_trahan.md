  "In my home office reads a piece of art that says, “She designed a life she
  loved”… and this could not be more true! Early on, I figured out two things I
  wanted to become; one was a mother and the other was a wedding planner. I
  married my high school sweetheart in 2009, and we now have three precious
  babies whom I absolutely adore! I planned my first wedding in 2002, and I have
  planned/executed over 600 weddings since then. A few years ago, I changed my
  focus to design plus planning and fell love with my career even more than
  before.  I firmly believe if you love what you do, you will never work a day
  in. your life!

  As owner and principal planner behind every Texture Event Rental event, my passion
  is to design, plan and execute flawless events that reflect the style of the
  client. It is my goal that although you may not remember what I said or did,
  you will never forget the way I made you feel.

  Favorite Things: Time with my family, a quiet bubble bath, Dr. Pepper and
  visiting new places!

  Favorite Design Element: Beautiful flowers and being able to transform a space
  by personalizing each element

  Favorite Wedding Moment: I have two, the Brides reaction when she sees all
  that we have created and the The moment right before the church doors open.

  Hannah graduated from the University of Louisiana with a Bachelor of Science
  in Business knowing that she would one day own her own wedding planning
  business. She earned certifications as a Certified Wedding Specialist through
  Beverly Clark Enterprises, became a Professional Bridal Consultant through the
  Association of Bridal Consultants.

  In college, she worked for The Family Church as the wedding coordinator,
  giving her the knowledge and experience needed to coordinate and handle
  ceremonies and all of the details involved. After graduation, she began
  working for local event venues, spending three years as the Events Manager at
  Townhouse Restaurant and Caterer before moving to City Club at River Ranch as
  the Private Events Director. She spent six years with City Club where she
  worked with a range of social to corporate events and all types of
  wedding-related events. In 2014, she fulfilled her long-time goal and opened
  Texture Event Rental Weddings, in 2019, she added full-service travel as part of
  Texture Event Rental. With the shift of her focus now being the design of the
  weddings she plans, she, along with her husband, launched Texture Rental
  Collection, a boutique rental company to offer custom builds to complete her
  designs and rental inventory."
