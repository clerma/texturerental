  "Event planning is perfect for my direct, yet fun-loving personality. With
  over fifteen years of experience planning private and corporate events, I am
  passionate about creating a beautiful and unique experience with you in mind.
  With a background in creative arts, I believe every event should be unique and
  specific to your personality. No matter the size, I approach each event with
  precise attention to detail, action-oriented coordination and creativity. I
  believe these qualities are the magic behind a successful event.

  Iâ€™m married to my best friend, Rudy, and we have three children, who love life
  and believe every day is a party! In our house we are real, we create, we make
  mistakes, we have fun, we say I'm sorry, we are really loud, we love deeply,
  and we make memories!

  I am grateful that I get to create and execute incredible experiences that
  will become special memories.

  Favorite things: my family, the beach, my church, sports, sweet iced tea, a
  good book, flower beds, and red velvet cake.

  Favorite Design Element: I love beautiful flowers and the perfect color
  combination, but my favorite design element is the one that makes yours unique
  and specific to your special day.

  Favorite Wedding Tradition: Giving of the Bride; the honor of giving the Bride
  to her Groom is meaningful and always a special moment in the ceremony."
