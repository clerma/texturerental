                    <p>One of my first mentors in the wedding & events industry taught me, "no" should never be a part of my professional vocabulary. He believed (that I, as the professional) should equip the client with every option and guide them to what they would eventually decide is best for them. This is one of the many things he taught me that I practice and firmly believe to this day. In 2012, I became certified through Sandals and Beaches resorts to book honeymoons and travel for my clients. This certification came from several requests from clients to help them with more than just the wedding day. This same thing is what has led to the newest expansion of my businessâ€”Southern Couture Travel! I still hate telling my clients "no" and too often I get requests from past and present clients who want to visit Hawaii, Mexico, Europe, or Disney and until now I was unable to assist. While I am not backing away from Sandals and Beaches at all, I will now be able to book your travel plans anywhere you want to go, and this is at no cost to you! Travel agents are paid by resorts or properties who already have a commission built in whether you use an agent or not, so let me assist you and I can answer your questions, before, during, and after your vacation.</p>
                    <p>Southern Couture Travel will be a part of My Paradise Planner, an established and reputable travel agency with 13 team members who possess a wealth of knowledge. I have been busy preparing to take on this new area of my business, but if I don't have the answer to your question immediately, this amazing team will make sure I do!</p>
