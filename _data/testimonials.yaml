  review: "Hannah is an absolute Godsend. I work in Lake Charles 6 days a week so it took a bit of coordinating to meet, but I never felt like it was an imposition on her. She never let on that anything was a bother or that a task was too much or too hard. I would have been lost without her To-Do List. I loved having someone who had my back 100%, who wasn't afraid to tell anyone what my vision was or afraid to put her foot down to achieve that. Hannah is worth her weight in gold and then some. My day would not have gone so smoothly if it wasn't for her and her team behind the scenes. My husband and I love Hannah and would HIGHLY recommend her to anyone who asks!"
