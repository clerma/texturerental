  review: "I rented the wooden x-back chairs from Texture for our wedding in October and they did an outstanding job! Communication was consistent and I never had any issues with them. Delivery and pick up were prompt and efficient and the chairs elevated the look of my reception! Would definitely recommend renting from Texture for any of your event decor needs!"

  review: "As Director of Sales of Le Pavillon in Parc Lafayette, I never worry about anything when we rent from Texture Rental Collection!!   All Equipment, Linens, Glassware, China, Flatware, Pipe, Drape, Stage Fronts, etc., are always clean and in great condition to use in Le Pavillon!  If you are in need of renting items, for a wedding ceremony, reception, birthday party, business gathering, etc., I highly recommend that you give Texture Rental Collection a Call! "

The great thing about texture is that they have years of experience with all aspects of the wedding industry so they can see things from different points of view which is incredibly helpful! I look forward to working with them for years to come!"
